# Leveraging LSTM and Attention Mechanisms for Improved Fake News Detection  


**Natural Language Processing Project – University of Milan (Master’s in Computer Science)**  

This project explores the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks combined with attention mechanisms to improve the detection of fake news. By leveraging these deep learning techniques, the model can capture contextual dependencies and linguistic nuances, enhancing classification accuracy.  

## 📌 Overview  

- **Objective:** Develop an advanced fake news detection system using LSTM and attention mechanisms.  
- **Dataset:** A balanced dataset of real and fake news articles. The provided version is **preprocessed**—to obtain the raw version, remove the `full_text` and `full_text_processed` columns.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Preprocessing and tokenisation of news articles  
  - LSTM-based model for sequential text analysis  
  - Attention mechanism to highlight key information in text  
  - Model evaluation and performance metrics
